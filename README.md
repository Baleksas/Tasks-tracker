### Description

I was inspired to create this web application in 2021 due to my passion for web technologies combined with my high interest in alien worlds and my unique taste in music at the time - [GRAViiTY](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ycxas0HqhZQQc7zkhtUJY?si=oxjAEBVQTIuFX_boaTiZyQ)

In 2023, I updated the application by: hosting the back-end on Google Cloud instead of Heroku, as well as upgraded the UI&UX and code-quality, utilizing my knowledge and experience gained through university and extracurricular activities.
